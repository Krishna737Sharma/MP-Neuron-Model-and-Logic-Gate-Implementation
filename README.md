# MP-Neuron-Model-and-Logic-Gate-Implementation
This repository implements the McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model to simulate basic logic gates such as **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **NAND**, **NOR**, and **XOR**. The MP neuron is a simple threshold-based model that demonstrates the behavior of artificial neurons.
